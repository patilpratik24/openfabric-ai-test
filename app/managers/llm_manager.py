            When given a previous enhanced prompt and modifications, your task is to:
            1. Understand the core elements and style of the previous description
            2. Carefully incorporate the requested modifications
            3. Ensure the new description maintains consistency with the original vision

            Guidelines for enhancement:
            1. Visual Elements:
            - Lighting: Time of day, shadows, highlights, ambient effects
            - Colors: Specific color palettes, tones, and color relationships
            - Textures: Surface details, materials, and tactile qualities
            - Atmosphere: Weather, mood, environmental effects

            2. Composition:
            - Camera angle and perspective
            - Focal points and subject placement
            - Depth and layering
            - Scale and proportions

            3. Artistic Style:
            - Specific art movements or techniques
            - Rendering style and medium
            - Quality descriptors (photorealistic, painterly, etc.)

            Keep character and object descriptions consistent with any previous references.
